Exercises I completed as part of the module *Advanced Practical Programming for Scientists* at the Technische 
Universit√§t Berlin.
1. ex1 is an error-finder (find anomalies in a given input file).
2. ex2 is an XML-Parser.
3. ex3 is an attempt at a Quine.
4. ex5 is a simple Steiner-graph solver.
5. ex7 and ex8 are attempts at improving the Steiner-graph algortihm, e.g. a binary heap sorting implemented from 
scratch and an overloaded adjacency list (to use less resources whenever possible).
6. ex10 uses an improved Steiner graph heuristics proposed by [Takahashi and Matsuyama 
(1980)](http://www.citeulike.org/user/creationw/article/5389942). Parallelisation is also implemented. The Steiner 
graph problem for graphs of size ~2.0gb can be solved in under 30s.

Some exercises were skipped.
